# Final Project for Computer Architecture Course

A 16-bit Register Stack architecture CPU that is coded and simulated using verilog

I was heavily involved in making the control unit, as well as other smaller components like the stack and ALU's. I also headed up writing the Assembler (coded in java) to turn our assembly code into machine code.

The main goal of this project was to be able to run Relative Primes on two numbers, which our processor successfully did, and had one of the highest clock speeds the professor had ever seen!
